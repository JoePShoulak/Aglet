# Aglet - Another Great Language Executing Things

To build, run `cargo build`. Alternately, to build and run, `cargo run`.

The only dependency is [Plex](https://github.com/goffrie/plex), for generating the parser. `cargo build` will automatically pull this in.

code style
- naming conventions (probably stick with how other rustaceans do)
- tabs vs spaces?
- open brace on same line or next line?
